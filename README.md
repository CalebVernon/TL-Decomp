# TL-Decomp

## Overview

TL-Decomp is an early-stage reverse engineering project focused on Tomodachi Life for the Nintendo 3DS. The goal is to analyze and document core game systems, such as islander data structures, friendship values, and event logic, in order to provide a foundation for future work and potential forks.

This project is intended for educational purposes and to facilitate collaborative research into game mechanics.

- **Initial setup:** repository created, basic structure in place  
- **Progress:** currently experimenting with identifying memory structures and game logic  
- **Limitations:** this is a personal project; I have limited experience with reverse engineering and C++/ARM code. Contributions and guidance are highly welcome.

## Goals

1. Identify key data structures (friendship, love events, islander stats)  
2. Map relevant functions and memory addresses  
3. Document findings clearly to allow others to build upon them  
4. Maintain a clean, accessible codebase suitable for contributors of all skill levels

## How to Contribute

- Familiarity with ARM/3DS reverse engineering is a plus  
- Experience with Ghidra, IDA, or similar tools is helpful  
- Testing hypotheses about game logic (friendship, love, events)  
- Documentation and code clean-up

## Disclaimer

This project is in the early stages and progress is slow. Code may be incomplete, and understanding of the game’s internal systems is limited. The repository is intended for learning and collaborative purposes only.
