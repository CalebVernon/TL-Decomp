# TL-Decomp

## Overview

TL-Decomp is an early-stage reverse engineering project focused on **Tomodachi Life (EU version)** for the Nintendo 3DS. The goal is to analyze and document **core game systems and code structures** in order to provide a foundation for research and educational purposes.  

This project is intended for **educational purposes only** and is not meant to produce a fully working game build. It focuses purely on the game’s code, memory structures, and function mapping.

- **Initial setup:** repository created, basic structure in place  
- **Progress:** currently experimenting with identifying memory structures and game logic  
- **Limitations:** this is a personal project; code is incomplete and may not compile or run as a full game. Contributions and guidance are welcome.

## Goals

1. Identify key data structures and memory layouts  
2. Map relevant functions and addresses  
3. Document findings clearly to allow others to study and build upon them  
4. Maintain a clean, accessible codebase suitable for contributors of all skill levels

## How to Contribute

- Familiarity with ARM/3DS reverse engineering is a plus  
- Experience with Ghidra, IDA, or similar tools is helpful  
- Documentation and code clean-up  
- Testing and verifying code snippets and structures

## Disclaimer

This project is in the early stages and progress is slow. Code may be incomplete, and understanding of the game’s internal systems is limited. The repository is intended **only for learning and research purposes** and is **not a full game build**.
